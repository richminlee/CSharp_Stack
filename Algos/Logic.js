// WEEK 2 DAY 1
// Puzzle 1

// 50 coins
// 4 coins are heads up, but you don't know which ones
// lights are off so you can't see
// Goal: flip over coins and split them in 2 piles so the same number of heads up coins are in each pile

// You can flip coins over as many times as you'd like
// all 50 coins are the same shape and weight and you cannot identify which are heads vs tails in any way.
// you can't put the coins on their sides :(



// Puzzle 2
